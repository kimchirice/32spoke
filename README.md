## 32spoke
The idea was to build a tool to help me re-build my long-hauled front wheel. Then it became a webapp helps everyone whose project is build a wheelset by himself(herself). I hope this help you calculate spoke length for the next build


## wheel variables
  1. Hub
    * Hub name
    * Hub weight
    * Left flange diameter
    * Right flange diameter
    * Left flange to center
    * Right flange to center 
    * Spoke hole diameter
 
  2. Rim
    * Rim name
    * Rim weight
    * Rim ERD
    * Offset spoke bed(OSB)
    * Max rim tension
    
  3. Lacing
    * Spoke name
    * Number of spokes
      - options are 16/18/20/24/28/32/36
    * Lacing pattern
      - options are radial / 1x / 2x / 3x
